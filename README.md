# FRAUD-TRANSACTION-DETECTION

A fraud transaction detection model is a data project that aims to identify fraudulent transactions in a dataset. This can be achieved through the use of various machine learning algorithms, such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor, and Support Vector Machine. These algorithms can be trained on a dataset of known fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions to identify patterns and characteristics that are indicative of fraud.

The performance of these algorithms can be measured in terms of their accuracy, precision, and recall in detecting fraudulent transactions. In some cases, one algorithm may perform better than others in detecting fraud, and the choice of algorithm may depend on the specific characteristics of the dataset and the desired level of accuracy.

Overall, a fraud transaction detection model can be a valuable tool in identifying and preventing fraudulent transactions, helping to protect businesses and consumers from financial loss.

I hope this summary provides a good overview of a fraud transaction detection model data project.
